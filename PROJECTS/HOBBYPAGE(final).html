    <h1>GIRLS CAN BUILD STUFF TOO!</h1>

    <p>A little about myself and how you too can start doing DIY projects</p>

    <p>MEDA Summer cohort 2020 | Val Rivera-Arriola</p>

    <h2>A LITTLE ABOUT ME:</h2>
    
    <p>My name is Val, I'm 23 years old and I'm San Francisco born and raised. I have a couple of different hobbies but the one I'm most proud
        of is doing DIY projects. These projects can be a number of things from fixing/upgrading things around the house or just
        learning a new skill like sewing so you don't have to pay someone else to do it. Most of the DIY things that I do is
        stuff around my house. We sometimes take on projects for other people, but we're real picky about it. One of the 
        reasons I picked this is up, my partner is a journeyman carpenter. So I come up with design and she turns my ideas into reality. 
        We've remodeled my bathroom, living room, kitchen, and bedrooms. From new floors, paint, all new plumbing, carpet, new cabinets, etc.
        We literally demoed everything and started with a clean slate so everything is brand new.
        One of the reasons we picked up doing things ourselves is because it's cheaper to pay for just the materials vs labor & materials. 
        Some projects that we've done for other people are my auntie's kitchen and my friend's bathroom. For my auntie's kitchen
        we installed new floors, re-painted the cabinets, added new hardware as in cabinet pulls, new sink/faucet, and added backsplash tiling which she didn't have before.
        The before and after pictures of my auntie's kitchen will be below in the "Additonal tips/resources" section.
        For my friend's bathroom, the house was built sometime in the 1920s and was never updated once until this day! So you
        can probably imagine how old and outdated it was. That project was a little more work than we anticipated. We tore out all
        the old tiling(floors/walls) and replaced with new modern tiles. New light fixtures, sink/vanity, toilet, and a bluetooth
        speaker mirror(her request). The cool, but also challenging thing about this project in particular was that the hot water
        wasn't working at all. So we tore out ALL the old plumbing and replaced it with new plumbing. In the end the water was working
        PERFECTLY! So those are just some examples of the type of things I like to do in my free time. Even though some of
        these things are hard work, doing something yourself is also way more rewarding.</p>

    <h2>GETTING STARTED:</h2>

    <p>First things first... figure out what it is that you what do you want to do! I'll be using an example of making a countertop out of wood and
        paint. 
        
        <h3>You need to do some research:</h3>
<ul>
            <li>What kind of countertop?(What materials do you want to use?)</li>
            <li>How do you want it to look?(Find inspiration on pinterest for example)</li>
            <li>How big do you want it to be?(calculate dimensions)</li>
            <li>What materials do you need?(How much they cost and quantity)</li>
            <li>Make a game plan: step by step, in what order are you going to do things, and
                how long it will take to make this countertop</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Before I ever start anything, it's always helpful to do research and watch tutorial videos that will help me
            along the process. Once you feel confident and have a good understanding on what to do, get started! First,
            you would cut your wood to size, glue and screw them together. Sand the whole area until leveled out, 
            including edges and corners until smooth. Get your paint, decorate how you want it. If you want your countertop 
            to be water resistant and protected against spills, you'd look into finding the best clear coat to go over the paint 
            layer. Then get ready to install on top of that cabinets. Of course, steps will vary with all different projects.</p>

    <h2>ADDITIONAL TIPS/RESOURCES:</h2>

    <p>Hardware store workers can be a lot of help also. They're usually very knowledgable in their departments
        so don't hesitate to ask their opinions on comparisons of different products! Don't be afraid to mess up, it
        happens. Most importantly have fun and be proud of the outcome no matter what.</p>
        <p>Here's a link to a video of how I did that island countertop(first picture above).
