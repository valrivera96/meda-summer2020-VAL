  <p>Hi, my name is Valentina Rivera-Arriola. Born and raised in San Francisco, California. I’m 23 years old and currently seeking to advance my career! I don’t have any experience in coding, but I’m currently learning and developing skills that I will have to use in the field. </p>

    <p>Most of my job experience is customer service based and security. I do physical security of a big tech company in San Mateo, CA called Snowflake Computing. Everyday I see how much this industry is growing and the demand for people working in this field is very high. Getting an inside look of how everyone works everyday has actually made me curious to what they do on a daily basis which led me to take an “Intro to coding” class. I’m more so testing out the waters to see if this is something that I’d actually like to pursue long term. I have an interest in the network security aspect, so I’m looking forward to see what that’s all about.</p>
