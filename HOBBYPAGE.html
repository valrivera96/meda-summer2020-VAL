    <h1>GIRLS CAN BUILD STUFF TOO!</h1>

    <p>A little about myself and how you too can start doing DIY projects</p>

    <p>MEDA Summer cohort 2020 | Val Rivera-Arriola</p>

    <h2>A LITTLE ABOUT ME:</h2>
    
    <p>My name is Val, I'm 23 years old and I live in SF, CA. I have a lot of different hobbies but one I'm most proud
        of is doing DIY projects. These projects can be a number of things from doing things around the house or just
        learning a new skill like sewing so you don't have to pay someone else to do it. Most of the DIY stuff that I do is
        stuff around my house. I've remodeled my bathroom, living room, kitchen, and bedrooms with my partner. From new floors,
        paint, new plumbing, etc. One of the reasons we picked up doing things ourselves is because it's cheaper to pay for
        just the materials vs labor & materials. I've done a number of projects for other people as well. Some examples would
        be my auntie's kitchen and my friend's bathroom. Also, doing something yourself is way more rewarding. </p>

    <h2>GETTING STARTED:</h2>

    <p>First things first... what do you want to do?! I'll be using an example of making a countertop out of wood and
        paint. 
        
        <ul>You need to do some research:

            <li>What kind of countertop?(What materials do you want to use?)</li>
            <li>How do you want it to look?(Find inspiration on pinterest for example)</li>
            <li>How big do you want it to be?(calculate dimensions)</li>
            <li>What materials do you need?(How much they cost and quantity)</li>
            <li>Make a game plan: step by step, in what order are you going to do things, and
                how long it will take to make this countertop</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>Before I ever start anything, it's always helpful to do research and watch tutorial videos that will help me
            along the process. Once you feel confident and have a good understanding on what to do, get started! First,
            you would cut your wood to size, glue and screw them together. Sand the whole area until leveled out, 
            including edges and corners until smooth. Get your paint, decorate how you want it. If you want your countertop 
            to be water resistant and protected against spills, you'd look into finding the best clear coat to go over the paint 
            layer. Of course, steps will vary with all different projects.</p>

    <h2>ADDITIONAL TIPS/RESOURCES:</h2>

    <p>Hardware store workers can be a lot of help also. They're usually very knowledgable in their departments
        so don't be afraid to ask their opinions are comparisons of different products! Don't be afraid to mess up, it
        happens. Most importantly have fun and be proud of the outcome no matter what.</p>
